    If you are modifying an existing plan, carefully follow the instruction, don't make unnecessary changes. Give the whole plan unless instructed to modify only one task of the plan.

Please output the complete plan after the new requirement is added, please keep the previous plan content, and do not change the previous plan content. 
        If the User New Requirement is a change based on the User Previous Requirement, please keep the reusable part of the previous plan, and continue to make a new plan after the reusable plan. Please output the content of the reusable plan and the complete plan after the change.
